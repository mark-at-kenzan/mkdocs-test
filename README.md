# mkdocs-test

This is a sample repository to test using the [MK Docs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) static site generator to create and deploy documentation.

* Documentation source files are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format.

* Site formatting is provided by the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for MkDocs.

* Additional formatting is provided by [Markdown Extensions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/) such as Admonition, CodeHilite, and PyMdown.

* After the site is generated, it is deployed to GitHub Pages using the `mkdocs gh-deploy` command.
